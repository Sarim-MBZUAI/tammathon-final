# ðŸš€ TAMM Hackathon 2025 â€“ AI Challenge Repository

This repository contains the code and resources for our submission to the **TAMM Hackathon 2025**, where we tackled **three real-world AI problems** using deep learning and computer vision.

## ðŸ§  Overview of Tasks

### ðŸ”¹ Task 1: Pet Face Recognition (PetFaceNet)
We built a **pet facial recognition system** capable of identifying pets from images using a metric-learning approach. Our solution uses a **ResNet-50 backbone**, **ArcFace loss**, and **Nearest Class Mean** for inference. This approach is designed to be scalable and adaptable to new pets with minimal retraining.

**Highlights:**
- Backbone: Modified ResNet-50
- Loss: ArcFace
- Distance Metric: Cosine similarity
- Top-3 Accuracy: **82%**
- Inference Time: ~3 minutes

### ðŸ”¹ Task 2: ICAO Photo Compliance Classification
We developed a binary classification model to identify whether a face photo complies with **ICAO passport standards**, addressing issues such as head alignment, lighting, and background uniformity.

**Highlights:**
- Model: ResNet-50 with class-weighted binary cross-entropy loss
- Data Augmentation: Horizontal flips
- Training Epochs: 20
- Imbalance Ratio: 1 (compliant) : 21 (non-compliant)
- Evaluation Metric: **F1-Score**

### ðŸ”¹ Task 3: Vehicle Damage Captioning
This challenge focused on generating **natural language descriptions of vehicle damage** from images. We used a multimodal architecture combining image feature extraction and a text generation transformer.

**Highlights:**
- Feature Extractor: ResNet-based CNN
- Caption Generator: Transformer (few-shot inspired prompting)
- Evaluation Metric: **METEOR Score**
- Sample Output: _"Car image with dent and broken lamp."_
